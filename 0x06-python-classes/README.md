## Files

| File Name | File Description |
| :-------- | :--------------- |
| 0-square.py | Defines an empty class `Square` that defines a square |
| 1-square.py | Builds off of 0-square.py to include `size` private instance attribute |
| 2-square.py | Builds off of 1-square.py to check `size` for errors |
| 3-square.py | Builds off of 2-square.py to add `area` calculation |
| 4-square.py | Builds off of 3-square.py to include setters and getters for `size` |
| 5-square.py | Builds off of 4-square.py to print the square with `my_print` |
| 6-square.py | Builds off of 5-square.py to handle a tuple that deals with position of the square |
| 100-singly\_linked\_list.py | Create 2 classes: `Node` and `SinglyLinkedList`. Can be instantiated to create a singly linked list |
| 101-square.py | Builds off 6-square.py to allow `print(my_square)` |
| 102-square.py | Builds off 4-square.py to allow comparisons on the `Square` class |
