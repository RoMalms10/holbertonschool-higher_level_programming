# Python Programming: Input/Output

## Purpose
* Learn how to open a file
* Learn how to write text in a file
* Learn how to read files
* Learn how to navigate in a file when it's open
* Learn how to use an implement the `with` statement
* Learn how to use and implement `JSON`
    - The terms: `serialization` and `deserialization`

## Files

| File Name | File Description |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| 0-read\_file.py | Function that reads a text file (in `UTF8`) and prints it to stdout |
| 1-number\_of\_lines.py | Function that returns the number of lines of a text file |
| 2-read\_lines.py | Function that reads n lines of a text file (in `UTF8`) and prints it to stdout |
| 3-write_file.py | Function that writes a string to a text file (in `UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written |
| 4-append\_write.py | Function that appends a string at the end of a text file (in `UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added |
| 5-to\_json\_string.py | Function that returns the `JSON` representation of an object |
| 6-from\_json\_string.py | Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a `JSON` string |
| 7-save\_to\_json\_file.py | Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a `JSON` representation |
| 8-load\_from\_json\_file.py | Function that creates an Object from a `JSON` file |
| 9-add\_item.py | Script that opens a `JSON` file and adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a `JSON` file |
| 10-class\_to\_json.py | Function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (`list`, `dictionary`, `string`, `integer` and `boolean`) for `JSON` serialization of an object
| 11-student.py | Defines a class `Student` with public instance attributes `first_name`, `last_name` and `age` |
| 12-student.py | Builds off of `11-student.py` to include `to_json` attribute selection |
| 13-student.py | Builds off of `12-student.py`  to include `reload_from_json` method that makes an instance of `Student` from `JSON` |
| 14-pascal\_triangle.py | Function that builds pascal's triangle based on the number of lines to be printed (n) |
